    "### Gender\n",
    "The gender of the passengers, which is defined as 0 for male and 1 for female, is an indicator of survival probability for the dataset under the k-Nearest Neighbors model. By analyzing the data, we can see that all of the females have a higher survival probability than all of the males. The lowest survival probability among women was 0.518519, while the highest survival probability for men was only 0.333333.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Age\n",
    "Age is less of an indicator of survival probability for the dataset under the k-Nearest Neighbors model. As the data shows, there are relatively similar clusters of age both at the higher and lower proabilities for survival. While it is slightly more likely for a younger person to have a higher rate of survival, there are also some potential outliers within the randomly selected dataset that do not give much strength to this claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fare\n",
    "The fare of the passengers is a good indicator of survival rate based on the k-Nearest Neighbors model. From the random testing selection, we can see that the lower fares paid tended to have a lower survival probability. On the other hand, the higher fares were more likely to have higher survival probabilities. In particular, the largest value within this selection was a significantly higher fare and survival probability than the rest of the passengers (134.5 farte and 0.925926 survival probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concluding Remarks\n",
    "The k-Nearest Neighbors model shows a trend of higher survival rates among females and those that paid higher fares. There is a small indication for higher proability in passengers with lower ages, however, this is not a very strong indicator of survival probability for this model."

    "### Detailed Report for Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report evaluates the performance of a Gaussian Naive Bayes model trained on the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived. The model was trained using the training set and validated using a validation set comprising 20% of the training data. Key performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the model is 77.65%. This means that approximately 77.65% of the predictions made by the model on the validation set are correct. While accuracy provides a general sense of the model's performance, it does not differentiate between the types of errors made.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision for the positive class (survived) is 71.25%. This metric indicates that when the model predicts a passenger survived, it is correct 71.25% of the time. Precision is crucial in scenarios where false positives are costly.\n",

    "#### Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall for the positive class (survived) is 77.03%. This metric measures the model's ability to correctly identify passengers who survived. A recall of 77.03% means that the model successfully identified 77.03% of the actual survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### F1 Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. For the positive class, the F1 score is 74.03%. The F1 score provides a balance between precision and recall, especially useful when the classes are imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions:\n",
    "- True Negatives (TN): 82\n",
    "- False Positives (FP): 23\n",
    "- False Negatives (FN): 17\n",
    "- True Positives (TP): 57\n",
    "\n",
    "From the confusion matrix, we observe that:\n",
    "- The model correctly identified 82 passengers who did not survive (true negatives).\n",
    "- The model incorrectly predicted that 23 passengers survived when they did not (false positives).\n",
    "- The model missed 17 passengers who survived (false negatives).\n",
    "- The model correctly identified 57 passengers who survived (true positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification Report\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (0: Did not survive, 1: Survived):\n",
    "- Class 0 (Did not survive): Precision = 83%, Recall = 78%, F1-score = 80%\n",
    "- Class 1 (Survived): Precision = 71%, Recall = 77%, F1-score = 74%\n",
    "\n",
    "The weighted averages for these metrics account for class imbalances, providing an overall view of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian Naive Bayes model shows reasonable performance with an overall accuracy of 77.65%. It demonstrates a good balance between precision (71.25%) and recall (77.03%) for predicting passenger survival. The F1 score (74.03%) indicates a robust model performance, considering the harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further improve the model, additional feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or employing more sophisticated models could be explored. Nonetheless, the current model provides a solid foundation for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features or interactions between existing features to provide the model with more relevant information.\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Although Naive Bayes has few hyperparameters, exploring different configurations or variations (e.g., Bernoulli Naive Bayes) may yield better results.\n",
    "3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining the predictions of multiple models (e.g., using a voting classifier) could improve overall performance.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: Implementing cross-validation during model training can provide more reliable performance estimates and help prevent overfitting.\n"
